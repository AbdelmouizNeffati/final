#### Description:
HELLO CS50 !
I decided for my final project to make a minimalist website yet eye-catching.
The premise of my website CAREER FIELDS is simple;It is web page that consists of visual represtantion of links to different academic 
and career fields' refernces and required diciplines.

File Descriptions :
1. index.html
This is the main file of the website. It defines the structure and content of the webpage using HTML. It contains:
The header, sidebar, and main content areas.
Links to external resources like stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images.
Elements for the various career fields (e.g., Business, Computer Science, Architecture, Medicine) and their related content.

2. styles.css
This file contains the styles and layout rules for the website. It ensures the website looks appealing and visually consistent by defining:
Colors, fonts, and spacing.
Layouts for different screen sizes (responsiveness).
Additional visual effects, like animations or hover states.

3. scripts.js
This file adds interactivity and functionality to the website using JavaScript. It includes:
Logic for the collapsible sections (e.g., expanding and collapsing career fields).
Features like background animations or dynamic interactions.
Functions to control the audio playback (start/stop music).

4. Image Files
These are the visual elements (logos, icons, etc.) displayed on the website. They enhance the user experience by adding graphical content to the sections. Examples:
business.png: Represents the Business field.
data-science.png: Represents the Computer Science field.
sketch.png: Represents the Architecture field.
caduceus-symbol.png: Represents the Medicine field.

5. PDF Files
These files provide educational resources for each career field. They are linked in the website to allow users to view or download relevant study material. Examples:
economics.pdf: Bachelor-level course on Economics.
data_structures.pdf: Bachelor-level course on Data Structures.
design_principles.pdf: Bachelor-level course on Architecture Design.

6. External Libraries
Bootstrap: A CSS framework linked via a CDN in index.html. It helps in building responsive and visually consistent layouts easily.
jQuery/Popper.js: JavaScript libraries used by Bootstrap for handling interactive components like collapsible menus.
